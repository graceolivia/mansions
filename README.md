# Mansions of New York City Interactive Map

There are beautiful mansions all over the Upper West Side of New York City. An evening stroll will take you past marble behemoths, beaux-arts confections, and austere brick beauties. This website is a guide for architecture lovers. Using leaflet.js, I have created an interactivate map where you can find and learn about different mansions.
